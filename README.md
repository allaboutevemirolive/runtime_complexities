# runtime_complexities
Analysis runtime complexities from best to worst


1. `O(1)` - Constant time complexity
2. `O(log log n)` - Double logarithmic time complexity
3. `O(log n) `- Logarithmic time complexity
4. `O(log n^c)` - Polylogarithmic time complexity
5. `O(sqrt(n))` - Square root time complexity
6. `O(n)` - Linear time complexity
7. `O(n log n)` - Linearithmic (or log-linear) time complexity
8. `O(n^2)` - Quadratic time complexity
9. `O(n^3)` - Cubic time complexity
10. `O(n^c)` - Polynomial time complexity, where c > 1
11. `O(c^n)` - Exponential time complexity, where c > 1
12. `O(n!)` - Factorial time complexity
13. `O(2^n^k)` - Double exponential time complexity
14. `O(n^n)` - Exponential time complexity
15. `O(k^n)` - Exponential time complexity, where k is a constant
