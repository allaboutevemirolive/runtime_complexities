```rust
fn constant_time() {
    let num = 42;
    println!("The number is: {}", num);
}
```

The provided code snippet has a function named `constant_time` that performs a simple operation. Let's analyze its runtime complexity.

The `constant_time` function performs the following steps:

1. It initializes a variable `num` with the value 42.
   - This step has a constant time complexity of O(1) because assigning a value to a variable takes a fixed amount of time, regardless of the value.

2. It prints a formatted string using `println!` macro, which includes the value of `num`.
   - The time complexity of printing a string is typically considered to be O(1) because it does not depend on the size of the string being printed.

Overall, the `constant_time` function consists of two constant-time operations. Therefore, the runtime complexity of this code can be considered as O(1), indicating that the execution time is constant and does not depend on the input size or any other factors.
